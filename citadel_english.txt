		"guide_world"			"Welcome, intergalactic tourists, to Fracture -- City of a Thousand Cities™! As you walk down our many historic streets and enjoy our countless parks and museums, you might think that Fracture’s just like any other bustling planet-capital in the galaxy. And in most ways, it is. But in other tiny but important ways, Fracture’s one of a kind.\n\nAs a for-instance: When you got off the shuttle at Bowl o’ Blood Spaceport, you probably got robbed. But not for all your money -- around 34% -- and you were given a receipt. Then you started yelling for the police, and you got robbed again.\n\nThat’s because Fracture is run by criminals. Now, that might sound like a bad idea, but if you read on, you’ll find out it’s actually one of the best darn ways a city could be run -- fine-tuned from centuries of illegality.\n\nHUMBLE BEGINNINGS\n\nWhile it might not look like it now, Fracture used to be a prison planet. That’s right! Prisoners were sent here to slave in the deep fissures of the planet’s crust, toiling away in the marrow mines until they died. That’s when the Founding Families realized -- \"\Hold on a minute. We’re alone on a planet here! We can do anything we want.\"\\n\nThat’s when Fracture truly began — its days as a prison mining planet behind it, and its bright future as an anything-goes prison utopia lying tantalizingly ahead.The galaxy still dumped off its law-defying folks, of course. And it was still pretty much impossible to escape the planet. But you could otherwise do mostly anything you wanted, unless you wanted to leave.\n\nNow, are the good folks of Fracture ashamed of their lawless past? Far from it! In fact, many folks here claim they can trace their lineage back to one of the twelve Founding Families!\n\nTHE FOUNDING FAMILIES\n\nSo who are the Founding Families, and why are they so important? Well, in the beginning, Fracture didn’t have a fancy mayor, or even laws or a way to enforce them. It wasn’t pretty. But what it had in abundance, being a prison planet, was criminals and walls. So the biggest prison gangs cut up the city into the Twelve Boroughs, with each family responsible for maintaining law and order.\n\nAnd crazily enough, it worked! If you wanted to commit a crime, you needed a permit for it, or there’d be hell to pay. Left to govern themselves, the criminals ended up being more organized and motivated than a government ever could’ve been. Sure, there was still crime -- but no surprises. You might be due to get mugged today, but you’d know about it, sure as jury duty.\n\nTHE GREAT BOROUGH BOOM\n\nAs the first planet in the galaxy to have institutionalized crime, Fracture was an overnight success. In fact, it was such a success, the population exploded. The walls of the twelve boroughs couldn’t contain all the fresh blood, and it quickly spilled over to the town’s outskirts. New boroughs were born. New walls were built. And these upstart gangs didn’t see much sense in paying tribute to a syndicate on the other end of town, when they had perfectly good rings in need of kissing right there.\n\nThis was known as The Great Borough Boom, an exciting and, as it turned out, deadly time in Fracture’s history that led directly to The Hundred-Borough War.\n\nToday it’s estimated there’s over a thousand boroughs jostling for elbow room in Fracture  -- but the truth is, the city’s such a shifting mosaic of alliances, backstabs, assassinations and startups, the census bureau’s never gonna get a headcount. \n\nAll you need to know is where you’re standing -- because wherever it is, you owe someone some respect.\n\nFRACTURE TODAY\n\nAs you can imagine, an ever-shifting map of alliances makes it hard to get around the city without making a lot of folks mad. That’s why the Bureau of Tourism recommends all newcomers to Fracture hire yourselves a guide to help you bribe, threaten and stab your way to all the culture, art and history Fracture has to offer."
		"guide_election"		"The Fracture Mayoral Election -- the greatest show of democratic bloodsport in the galaxy!\n\nTo visitors from more \"\traditional\"\ planets, having an election settled by bullets instead of ballots may seem like a bit of a culture shock, so read on and learn how Fracture redefined Democracy for these modern times.\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE OF IMPARTIALITY\n\nAs the first and only planet in the galaxy to have institutionalized crime, Fracture had discovered a new problem. For the first time in our history, people were coming here willingly. The sudden population explosion led to The Great Borough Boom. And that led to the dark days of The Hundred Borough War.\n\nThus, the role of the Mayor was invented to re-establish Fracture’s unique brand of lawless order. Back then, the Mayor was more like a judge. One time she was an Djinn (Hammurabi the Fire-Wise). Another time it was a robot (S.O.L.O.M.O.N.). But every time, the Mayor was the one person in Fracture you could take an inter-borough dispute to, knowing for certain that they were impartial, unbiased, and incorruptible.\n\nBut that’s the thing about Fracture: We never give up. And while it may have taken us thousands of years, we eventually found a way to buy off a robot mayor and ruin our perfect legal system.\n\nBut, as luck would have it, we accidentally invented an even better one! It turned out a corruptible mayor was an even bigger boon to the city than an incorruptible one.\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE OF CORRUPTION\n\nLet’s say you’re the leader of a gang. You’ve worked hard to put your borough on the map. The shake-down money is rolling in from local businesses, you’ve cornered the market on fake designer handbags, and your crew has more ammunition than they could hope to fire in a lifetime.\n\nNow, according to the stupid law, you shouldn’t be able to take over the borough next door, even though it’s run by a spoiled brat who inherited it from his dad and he’s running it into the ground. What’s fair is that the borough is technically his. What’s right is that it should be yours.\n\nOnce word got out that a little hard work and backroom dealing could move the borough borders in a gang’s favor, competition once again thrived in Fracture.\n\nON THE VERGE OF WAR\n\nOver time, it became clear that having a mayor in your corner could make the difference between your borough thriving or dying. With every election season that passed, tactics got a little more brutal. What started as simple bribes to the mayor turned into assassination attempts. Paying for votes turned to threatening the voters. In time, Fracture was on the verge of its first-ever Thousand Borough War.\n\nWith the city on the brink, a Conclave was held in the one neutral part of town, the City Center. Representatives from every borough showed up to negotiate a peaceful solution -- Here's what they came up with.\n\nA SINGLE BATTLE\n\nGoing forward, mayoral elections would be settled by a single knock-down, drag-out fight in the City Center, winner take all. Each candidate meets with all the boroughs they’re in bed with, and selects six champions to represent them in the fight.\n\nNow, these six representatives might not like each other -- in fact, they might have plenty of good reasons to kill each other -- but if they want all the favors, kickbacks and special treatment their candidate promised them, that mayor needs to win. So for one day only, they’d better work together."	
		"guide_factions"		"A criminal ecosystem as rich and diverse as Fracture is full of orginizations that are constantly jockying for power in the city. Here's a handy guide of some of the more prominant factions that have taken an interest in this years election cycle.\n\nTHE 7TH MOON\n\nThe 7th Moon is not just one of the founding families of Fracture; it's the criminal institution with the longest lineage of leadership in the entire city.  Driven by history, tradition, and a strict hierarchy - one family has run The 7th Moon for generations, and there is no sign of that stopping anytime soon.\n\nTHE 8TH SUN\n\nTo most people; death is the end.  To the leaders of The 7th Moon, it's a promotion.   Comprised entirely of the undead elders of The 7th Moon; The 8th Sun once acted as a shadow council that would quietly advise their decendents.  However, that all changed during the Hundred Borough war when The 8th Sun revealed themselves to the world.  Now an \"\independant\"\ orginization,  the elderly undead mostly keep to themselves.\n\nTHE ALLIANCE\n\nThe Fracture Tourist Beaureau would like to remind visiting members of the Intergalactic Alliance that Fracture is a soverign city planet and that none of your laws, rules, titles, or customs are obligated to be observed.  The Beaurau would also like to remind Fracture locals that while profiting off of The Alliance is certainly in the spirit of our great city: declaring fealty to The Alliance is not, and may be grounds to lose citizenship.  Collaborate with the Alliance against your fellow citizens at your own risk.\n\nTHE CONSTABLES\n\nThe robot peace keepers that make up The Constables are the closest thing to an unbiased party in Fracture.  Acting as a deterent when inter-borough disputes can't be resolved between themselves; when The Constables show up most gangs know it's time to back off.\n\nTHE GREY\n\nREDACTED BY THE GREY. A REWARD WILL BE OFFERED TO ANYONE WHO TURNS IN OLDER EDITIONS OF THIS PUBLICATION THAT HAD WRITTEN INFORMATION ON THE GREY.\n\nTHE HAUNTS\n\nThe Haunts: an organization that specializes in assassinating the supernatural.  Unfortunately for The Haunts, science is a thing. As such, almost everyone in the galaxy thinks they're a bunch of zealots who use mumbo jumbo to justify the murder of anyone that gets in their way.\n\nTHE LOST BATTALION\n\nMembers of the Lost Batallion insist that they are veterans of the Delcano Time War.  Sadly, there's no record of such a war ever occurring.  Whether this is because the whole story is made up, or if because time was forever altered is up for debate.  But here's a pro-tip to visitors who have a vested interest in not breathing through a tube: don't tell a member of The Lost Battalion that the time war never happened.\n\nTHE MEAKASHI\n\nAs word of the criminal utopia that is Fracture spread throughout the galaxy, criminals from every corner of the cosmos sought to visit, thinking it would be a great place for their murder-vacations. However, the illicit ecosystem in Fracture is a delicate one.  Each gang has a role to play, and rules to follow... and the city of Fracture has no interest in letting tourists mess that up.  That's where the Meakashi come in:  a crew of bounty hunters (more like a biker gang) that roam the boroughs; hunting down those off-world criminals that flaunt the rules of Fracture.\n\nTHE PROTEAN COALITION\n\nWhile undoubtably you've heard about the pleasant small-town vibe of the 48th Borough,  tourists are advised to stay away unless specifically granted permission by The Protean Coalition: a collection of were-folk that calim that land as their own.\n\nTHE TUNNEL RATS\n\nLooking for that special bottle of liquor to celebrate a heist?  Or maybe your birthday's coming up and you really want some macarons.  In Fracture, you can find anything... but the real question is \"\how do I  get it?\"\.  Between gang wars, cold wars, trade wars, and wars wars; there are dozens of reasons why access to your favorite items made in a specific borough may be unaccessasble.  And when you run into one of those situations you're going to need The Tunnel Rats.  Specilizing in inter-borough trade routes; The Tunnel Rats are expects and moving product from one borough to another.\n\nTHE WRECKAGE MOVEMENT\n\nDid you happen to see that burned out husk of a night club in the 819th Borough?   That's not the result of domestic terrorism, it's just a new form of street art pioneered by The Wreckage Movement!  If you're interested in buying a proffesional colleague a custom demolition for their place of business, don't hesitate to contact Ballista.\n\nPARADOX\n\nFracture is full of criminals, but only the best are invited to join Paradox - Fracture's premiere thieves guild.  Now, it may sound intimitating to visit a borough run by the galaxy's greatest collection of catburglers, grifters, and second-story men; but don't worry! Lead by the enigmatic Chrono, Paradox prides themselves on constructing elaborate heists that target the must untouchable of individuals and institutions... so unless you happen to be traveling with a collection of ancient artifacts or are an intergalactic head of state you have little to fear from Paradox.\n\nTHE DISCIPLES OF CREELA\n\nA relatively new institution in Fracture; The Disciples of Creela are one part assassin cartel, one part religious cult, and one part multi-level marketing company.\n\nSMUGGLER'S LOCAL 3150\n\nAre you a smuggler looking for a new ship and need a storage solution for predatory off-world animals?  Or perhaps you're exporting recreational munitions and fusion bombs and really don't want to deal with all the hassle non-Fracture governments impose on their citizens?  Then you need to contact Smuggler's Local 3150: a union made up of the planets most skilled craftsfolk.\n\nSTRIKE TEAM ENDEAVOR\n\nOnce; Strike Team Endeavor was the most decorated black ops group in The Alliance Special Forces.  Today, they've been declared anathema and are now seen as enemies of the state in the eyes of The Intergalactic Alliance.  Taking refuge in Fracture, Strike Team Endeavor now offers their particular set of skills to the highest bidder."
		"guide_locations"		"While City Center has been closed off to prepare for The Election Battle, there are plenty of places to explore in Fracture -- some of them might even be safe!\n\nTHE BEAR PIT\n\nHome to Fracture's number one combat sport \"\Robot Rumble\"\ ; The Bear Pit is an arena with an atmosphere like none other.  In it's hallowed halls; Kali, Bebop, and Lash rose from obscurity to become icons in the sport.\n\nJEONG'S DUMPLINGS AND MORE\n\nCome for the dumplings, stay for the black market tech auction that happens after hours!\n\nTHE BOY AND THE DRIZALOTH\n\nA NEW DINING CONCEPT COMING SOON TO FRACTURE (PENDING ACQUISITION OF LIQUOR lICENSE FROM THE MAYOR)\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT ROBO RALLY\n\nLooking for danger and excitement?

Special note to attendees with small children: an average MRR will usually claim the lives of 4 racers and 19 live attendees so be sure to wear a poncho!\n\n854 INDUSTRIAL MEAT MANAGEMENT\n\nCome see the place where Kelvin decided that he wanted more in life than just having a bathroom at his workplace!  There's really not much to see.  It's a meat packing plant.  But the owners paid for product placement so check it out!\n\nTHE DEEP\n\n Did you know that in addition to all the open violence and grift you see on our streets there is a whole 'nother world of crime waiting to be explored?  If you're feeling adventurous, put on some scuba gear and explore The Deep; where the criminal mysteries of ocean life await you.\n\nTHE ATTIC\n\nThe Attic is the main base of operations for The Haunts.  Here in this grand murder cathedral, new recruits are \"\trained\"\ (read: indoctrinated) in the skills needed to fight the \"\supernatural\"\ (read: anyone The Haunts leadership deems needed to be removed).\n\nTEMPLE OF KREELA\n\nLooking to dedicate your life in service to a questionable Goddess of Assassination?  Speak to Haze at the Temple of Kreela.\n\nFRACTURE COOPERATIVE IXITH DISTILLARY\n\nWe may not like the Alliance here in Fracture, but many citizens of the city love the proprietary liquor they make there.  That's why our patriotic citizens stole the materials needed to set up their own Ixith Distillary here on Fracture... it's the closest you can get to the real thing without stealing it yourself.\n\nLASH'S DOJO\n\nHey. Lash here.  There was no way The Lash was going to let the city write a bio for his place of business --  words can't describe poetry in motion.  Just check out the Dojo.  Be inspired.  Be humbled.  Be better than your sucky self. -L.\n\nMOLE TOWN\n\nLooking to step away from the hustle and bustle of the lower 100 Boroughs?  Pay a visit to Mole Town where galaxy renowned Mole artisans craft traditional furniture, art, and jewlery.\n\nSTRIKE OUT BOWLING AND BIKES\n\nIf the Meakashi's first love is roughing up tourists, their second is bowling, so it's no wonder they added a 10 lane bowling alley to their bike shop.  If you're feeling particularly adventureous be sure to swing by on Wednesday nights for \"\The Deadliest Kareoke In The Galaxy\"\.\n\nTHE PARADOX MUSEUM\n\nNestled in the 93rd Borough is the Paradox Museum: a remarkable  collection of art, government secrets, antiquities, and celebrity paternity tests all stolen by the notorious thieves guild.  Admission is free for children and anyone who provides blackmail material.\n\nTHE DEEP EMBASSY (FORMERLY FRACTURE AQUARIUM)\n\nWhile many of the conflicts of The Deep stay localized to its 30 Borough trench, sometimes it's denizens need to interact with the surface.  If you're looking to do business with seahorse loan sharks or psychic sea anemones; here's the place to do it.\n\nCITY CENTER\n\nCity Center (or as the locals call it: District Zero) is the heart of Fracture.  Because violence of any kind is forbidden in City Center, it's a popular destination both for tourists looking to not get stabbed, and citizens brokering inter-borough deals alike. The only exception of course, is during The Election Battle, where District Zero turns into the most violent spectacle in the galaxy."
