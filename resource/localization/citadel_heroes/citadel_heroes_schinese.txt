Content with being a Sheriff in a small town, Holliday enjoyed a career where the only time she had to use her gun was when trick shooting at the county fair...then the murders started.\n\nGrisly and inhumane; the bodies were found with their ribcages ripped open... their innards picked apart as if by birds.  Holliday tracked down the killer, a travelling folk musician that the media dubbed \"The Troubadour\", but when she confronted him he exploded into a murder of crows and flew away.\n\nThat was 6 months ago, and while the murders in central illinois have stopped, Holliday's investigation has not.

But that doesn’t mean there is no war… just that war has changed.\n\nParanormal Military Companies have risen to prominence.  These groups, using a combination of extra-planar creatures and various blood magics; have found ways to circumvent the guardrails established by the nation’s watchdog oracles, allowing them to function as proxies for nations seeking to wage war.\n\nWrecker is one such soldier.\n\nEmployed by Eldritch Tactical Solutions (a subsidiary of Fairfax Industries), Wrecker is an elite soldier of fortune with a reputation for doing dirty work that other PMC’s don’t have the stomach for."

And that’s when Oathkeeper revealed himself.  A powerful spirit from another plane, Oathkeeper offered her a path to reclaim her past glories… he could restore her youth; all she had to do was drain the essence of the living to sustain herself. \n\nGeist was torn.  Obviously murder was ghoulish business, and undoubtedly Oathkeeper was not an entity that could be trusted… but still, the thought of having a second chance of reliving her youth was too good to pass up.  And so she concocted a plan: after making a pact with Oathkeeper she would bind and ward him, limiting his influence and pull over her.  Oathkeeper would still get fed; but on her terms, not his.\n\nHowever, as years have turned to decades; the strength of the Ward has weakened, and Oathkeeper hungers more than he ever has in the past… "
		"hero_gigawatt_lore"			"When mystic energy awoke on Earth, the world changed... anything was possible.  But just because anything WAS possible, didn’t mean that anything SHOULD be possible.  And so the government made rules.   Laws.  A means for US citizens to enjoy the benefits of the supernatural world in safety.  But rules and laws are for lesser men.  Men with limitations.  Men who were not Seven.  \n\nThere are many rumors about what Seven did to land himself in Lost Whisper, an oubliette for the most dangerous of occultists.  But there is no doubt about what happened on the night of his execution. \n\nWards placed by the most powerful ritualists of 7 different nations… wards designed to not just prevent mystical interference with the execution, but to simultaneously obliterate Seven's soul so that it could never be contacted, resurrected, or otherwise be used by someone looking to follow in his footsteps... failed.\n\nOnlookers viewed in horror as the strongest mentalist employed by the US Army’s head popped like a grape.  They screamed as Scotland Yard’s premiere occult investigator, the one who allegedly captured Seven, crumbled to ash.  Seven's body buckled and writhed against his restraints; his skin burning from eldritch electricity... and yet he would not die.  He laughed.\n\nHe laughed as he tore himself free from his bondage.\n\nHe laughed as his captors cowered in fear.\n\nHe laughed as he massacred his tormentors.\n\nHe laughed as he tasted the fresh air that was denied to him for years.\n\nAnd he laughed when he thought about what he was going to do once he reached New York City."

		"hero_inferno_lore"				"Like most teenagers; Infernus was wild, rebellious, and impetuous.  Unlike most teenagers, Infernus was a creature from another plane and had a supernatural mastery over fire.  Needless to say:  his youth was filled with no small amount of arson, murder, and evidence disposal.  But that was then.  Now an adult, Infernus has mellowed out considerably.  He’s happy working at a bar with good live music, and talking to interesting people.  That being said when someone at the bar gets belligerent or violent, he’s not afraid to dust off the skills he once honed."
		"hero_kelvin_lore"				"A famed adventuring scientist, Kelvin made it his life's mission to explore and understand the unknowable.  So naturally when rumors surfaced regarding an 8th astral gate hidden in the arctic, Kelvin couldn't build an expedition team fast enough.  Assembling the brightest minds of his generation, Kelvin and his team set forth with much fanfare.\n\nThey never returned.\n\nA year and a half later the frozen body of Kelvin was found by a fishing trawler, his corpse clutching a rock etched with glowing runes.  The crew chipped away at the ice, looking to get a closer look at the body and were shocked when Kelvin opened his eyes.  They checked his vitals... there was no pulse.  They sought to bandage his open wounds... there was no blood.  And yet, impossibly, Kelvin was \"alive\".\n\nHaving no memory of what happened on the expedition, Kelvin is looking for answers."

		"hero_krill_lore"				"Mo and Krill are members of The Tunnel Rats, a group that help facilitate illicit trade and commerce between the boroughs thanks to a network of underground tunnels.

		"hero_nano_lore"				"Granted the dubious honor of being named Time Magazine's most dangerous woman on the planet, Calico is an enigmatic occult arms dealer that is willing to fund any and all sides of a conflict if the price is right.\n\nWhile her critics (and friends) would correctly identify her as being amoral, she is not without her principles... however cold and calculated those principles may be."
		"hero_orion_lore"				"A founding member of \"The Baxter Society\", Wesley Grey Talon spent close to 40 years hunting monsters that preyed on man before finally deciding to find a replacement and lay down his bow. Grey Talon's duties had meant that he never spent much time with his wife and kid, and now that his son had started a family of his own he realized that this was his last chance to reconnect with the people he loved.\n\nRetirement suited Wesley.  He made up for lost time with his wife.  He doted on his grandkids.  He cooked dinner for the whole family every Wednesday.  He was happy.\n\nThen he got the call.\n\nThe authorities claimed that it was a freak accident... that the fire consumed his son's house before anyone got a chance to escape.  But Wesley knew better.  His son's wife was Ixian... she could snuff out flame with a thought.  If their bodies were found burned they had to be dead long before there was a fire.\n\nAnd so Grey Talon has picked up his bow once more, and when he finds who's responsible there will be a bloody reckoning."

		"hero_viscous_lore"				"The Bermuda Triangle was never a myth, it was a shadowline nexus deep underneath the Atlantic Ocean.  For the most part, the things that escaped this astral gate were benign (like Nessie), but now something dark and predatory hunts the seas... and its denizens are scared to death.\n\nOne of those inhabitants, a psychic sea anemone, wants to do something about it.  Psychically building itself an ectoplasmic goo body so it can survive on the surface, Viscous desperately is trying to summon The Patrons to keep The Deep safe from the adversary that lurks below."
		"hero_warden_lore"				"Most people think the supernatural came into the world 50 years ago.  They’re wrong.  Its presence shaped folklore for generations… and as long as there have been people afraid of the shadows, there have been those who dedicated their lives to fighting in them.\n\nComing from a lineage of militant alchemists, Warden’s family always trained for the day they would have to stave off a mystic apocalypse… but as time passed the importance of the lessons seemed less and less important.  What once was viewed as a sincere warning slowly morphed into being perceived as amusing anecdotes told by their superstitious grandparents.\n\nWhen the portal opened in Central Park, Warden’s parents realized not only was everything they were told was true, they were unprepared.  Refusing to let the next generation fall asleep on the job, Warden was trained since birth to be a supernatural killing machine with one purpose: stopping the Patrons from ever entering our world."

And so the gargoyle leapt to action, sending the attackers fleeing in horror.  The small human said thank you and asked the gargoyle's name.  The gargoyle didn't have one.  And so the small human said, \"I'm going to call you Ivy.\"  The gargoyle, being covered in ivy at the time, thought it was a bit obvious, but decided to go along with it for the small human's sake.\n\nThe humans asked if Ivy would come home with them so they could show their appreciation, and so Ivy walked with them.  That night she learned much.  The family were called The Arroyo's.  The little one, Sophia.  Mofongo is what they called a plate of deliciousness.  But most importantly, she learned that the people attacking them were called \"The Mendoza Syndicate\", and they were hurting people...nice people like The Arroyo's.\n\n18 years have passed since the day the Arroyo's took Ivy home... and during that time she made it her mission to dismantle the Mendoza Syndicate and free Spanish Harlem from its grasp.  However the thing about dedicating your life to a single pursuit for nearly 2 decades is that you don't really know what to do once you achieve it.  For the first time in her life, Ivy is prepared to venture outside of Spanish Harlem and see what the world has to offer beyond vigilante justice."
